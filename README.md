# UbuntuDDE with CSS Experiment

UbuntuDDE as you know it's a powerful Ubuntu with the most beautiful desktop environment (DDE desktop).

in this project i tried to create some parts from it with (HTML & CSS & JS) that the fake login page and the desktop with fake (terminal, chromium browser, files, menu, notifications and so on)

and as you will see not everything is fully functional and at least as regards the desktop. 

1. **Login page**
    This section mainly consists of a clock, two images (username avatar & background), and a password field.
    I used javascript only for the clock, and the fake login when the user press any key
